;; WARNING: This is a terrible hack written in an attempt to support the
;; terrible hacks implemented by Outlook. The author takes no responsibility and
;; users are encouraged to closely inspect the generated message before sending!

;; Not much is going on in lisp: We need a reference to the parent message (the
;; message being replied to) so we can forward its ID to mimelook.py. mu4e
;; exposes the message being replied to in the variable
;; `mu4e-compose-parent-message' in the pre-compose hook, so we grab it, store
;; it in `mimelook/mu4e-parent-message', and then store it in a local variable
;; in the `mu4e-compose-mode-hook'.

;; Before sending, we call `mimelook/mu4e-outlook-madness'. This will take the
;; current body text and parent message ID from the buffer and send it to an
;; external Python script (mimelook.py). This script then does several things:

;; 1) It generates an HTML version of the body text (assuming it is Markdown
;; syntax, with the rationale that "the single biggest source of inspiration for
;; Markdownâ€™s syntax is the format of plain text email" [1]).

;; 2) It finds the parent message using mu and the message id and parses it
;; using the Python mailparser module.

;; 3) It fetches all inline attachments (usually images) of the parent message,
;; which is commonly used in Outlook users' signatures, and stores them in a
;; directory in /dev/shm/.

;; 4) It grabs the HTML body text of the parent message

;; Finally, a multipart message is generated with the structure:

;; <#multipart type=alternative>
;;  <<untouched plaintext that was in the buffer before calling `mimelook/mu4e-outlook-madness'>>
;; <#part type=text/html>
;;  <<everything in the parent message HTML upto and including the <body> tag>>
;;  <<the plaintext from our buffer, converted to HTML via Markdown>>
;;  <<an Outlook-style message citation block with "From: x, To: y, Subject: z, ...">>
;;  <<everything in the parent message HTML from (but excluding) the <body> tag>>
;; <#/multipart>
;;  <<a <#part ...><#/part> for each inline attachment>>

;; This message overwrites the content of the buffer, which can then be sent as
;; usual (usually with C-c C-c).

;; The result is a message that has a nice, sane plaintext version as we wrote
;; it in mu4e. It also has an insane HTML version that renders nicely for
;; Outlook users and contains the entire mail thread being replied to below the
;; message being sent, as Outlook users usually expect.

;; For debugging, the HTML part is written to /dev/shm/mimelook-madness.html for
;; inspection. This file will automatically be opened in a browser if
;; `mimelook/mu4e-outlook-madness' is called with a prefix argument. Do note
;; that inline attachment images are NOT rendered in this preview!

;; If an Outlook user sends us a plaintext email, don't attempt to produce an
;; HTML reply with `mimelook/mu4e-outlook-madness'. Instead refer to
;; `mimelook/enable-outlook-reply-style', which will set
;; `message-citation-line-function' to an Outlook-style (but plaintext) citation
;; line (will also change yank prefixes). These are bound to C-c C-S-o and C-c
;; C-o.
